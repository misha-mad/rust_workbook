## 1. Hello, World!

A simple program that prompts the user for their name and greets them with "Hello, {name}!".

## 2. Guessing Game

A number guessing game where the computer selects a random number, and the user tries to guess it.

## 3. Fahrenheit to Celsius Converter

Converts a temperature value from Fahrenheit to Celsius.

## 4. Fibonacci Sequence

Generates and displays the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.

## 5. Find First Word

Finds and extracts the first word from a given text input.

## 6. Rectangle Area Calculator

Calculates and displays the area of a rectangle based on user-provided width and height values.

## 7. Random String Generator

Generates a random string of specified length using the characters A-Z, a-z, and 0-9.

## 8. Grep-like Text Search

A program that performs a text search operation similar to the "grep" command, allowing users to search for specific patterns in text files.

## Usage

To run any of the programs in this collection, navigate to the root directory of the project and use the following command:

```shell
cargo run -- <project_id>
```

or (for a grep-like program)):

```shell
cargo run -- <search_text> <file_path>
```
